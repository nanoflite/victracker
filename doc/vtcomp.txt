vtcomp - a song compiler/compressor for victracker modules.

DESCRIPTION
  vtcomp compresses the module files (.vt) created using vic-tracker
for the Commodore vic-20 computer.  It creates an assembly language
source file which contains the compressed music data, and the player
code optimized specifically for this particular music.
The output is suitable for use in demos or games, both for unexpanded
and expanded vic-20s.  I addition, because you have the source code
you may move things around and do additional optimizations to suit your
special application.

OPTIMIZATIONS
  The size of the generated code/data greatly depends on the number of
patterns used, which effects where used, and so on...

The demo songs vary between (2003-08-27)
  mystic.vt        $419 bytes - only portamento.
  blippblopp.vt    $423 bytes - this uses only sound activated
                                arpeggios.
  vt-theme.vt      $71e bytes - this uses pretty much everything.
  slowride.vt      $76c bytes - pretty much everything in this one too.
  djungel-zagor.vt $86a bytes - multiple songs, portamento and arpeggios.

The demo songs vary between (2003-08-26)
  mystic.vt        $44e bytes - only portamento.
  blippblopp.vt    $45e bytes - this uses only sound activated
                                arpeggios.
  vt-theme.vt      $723 bytes - this uses pretty much everything.
  slowride.vt      $771 bytes - pretty much everything in this one too.
  djungel-zagor.vt $86f bytes - multiple songs, portamento and arpeggios.

HINTS
If you do not use any arpeggios, roughly xx bytes will be saved.
If you do not use any portamento, roughly xx bytes will be saved.
If you do not use the volume channel, roughly xx bytes will be saved.

USAGE

usage: vtcomp [OPTION]... <infile> <outfile>

Valid options:
    -t <title>      set/override the module title field
    -a <author>     set/override the module author field
    -y <year>       set/override the module year field
    -p              pack <infile> to <outfile>
    -c              convert <infile> to the current format
    -o              optimize <infile> and write to <outfile>
    -L <path>       library path (to find runner.asm and player.asm)
    -v              be verbose
    -d <level>      output a lot of (weird) debugging information
    -v              be verbose
    -h              displays this help text
    -V              output program version

REQUIREMENTS
  vtcomp should compile on any unix-like system, just type 'make' (or 'gmake'
on some systems)
If there is enough demand I might consider porting it to Win32 aswell.
vtcomp will require that you have perl and sed installed (nearly every unix
system will have it).  It will also require that you have dasm-2.12.04
installed somewhere in your path.

APPENDIX
  See the file algorithm.txt for some details about the compressed format.
