TODO for victracker

General:
  - Fine tune make system, make dist should build binaries aswell.
  - better documentation
  - more demo songs
  - zip archive should contain the directory listing of the d64 as a file.
    (a dir option to makedisk.pl?)

Player:

  - fix handling of sound referenced arpeggios, offset and glide
    in combination with delay note (doesn't seem to be a problem.)
  - how to handle an arpeggio that gets introduced during a tie?
  - how to handle an arpeggio that gets changed?
  - make tempo set only the low nybble of the speed, and make a special
    command to set the high nybble.

  optimize:
  - tidy up optimizations that make use of arpeggio modes.
    Maybe by adding PL_SUPPORT_ARPMODExx_ONLY, etc...
  - optimize the patternlist.
  - optimize a lot!  Initial frequency offset takes a lot of time!
    portamento shift could be calculated once.
  - Oneshot support / make oneshot happen at the right moment.
  - extremely simplified version of player.
  - <1Kb player?

  - special effects suited for the volume/tempo channel
  - special effects suited for the noise channel

  (- implement mode 2 arpeggios.)
  (- selectable scales?)
  (- Emulation of NTSC on PAL machines and vice versa.)
  (- effect: vibrato)
  (- sound param: vibrato.)
  (- sound param: vibrato delay?)
  (- player with some kind of pitch correction?)
  (- player with PWM?)

Packer:
  - win32 version?  (=autoconf/mingw32)
  - handle calling of perl and shell stuff in a better way!
    i.e remove the sed and cat stuff.
  - should have a switch to output a song binary at a special location.
  - should really know where to find its own files runner.asm and player.asm
  - Debug mode for runner.asm  (enabled by a switch)
  - runner.asm should calculate rasterlines including LSB.
  - fix bug that makes the empty pattern doubled
    it seems that it is due to that the empty pattern is used both
    in the voices, and in the noise channel.
  - duplicate pattern removal.
  - duplicate pattlist removal.
  - possibility to save an optimized song (for testing purposes).
  - Put loads of status info in the assembly output.
  - packer optimization by splitting in to more patterns.
  - maybe parse output from dasm?

Editor:
  - editable/displayable author information.
  - SHIFT/C= should be disabled
  - selectable noninv/inv sync-mode.
  - clean up sync24 code.  Check for bad lock up bugs!
  - clean up and comment code.  Especially the editor code.
  - refactor player flags.
  - Go to main screen when loading or initializing song.
  - improve the transpose functionality.
  - Make ( <- ) not advance down.
  - selectable device number?
  - tape load/save... i.e make it work with cbmlink
  - function to renumber patterns
  - add edit functionality for oneshot.
    (done, but isn't supported by the player)
  - copy/paste in patternlist?  This will not happen until we unify the
    copy/cut/paste/ins/del/clr logic in editor.asm.
  - inst/del in patternedit?  This will not happen until we unify the
    copy/cut/paste/ins/del/clr logic in editor.asm.
  - Play start shall be done such that the PlayColor1 bar shall be the
    first fetch.
  - Why does the editor hang when loading a 12Kb module?
    (Is something used high in mem?)

  (- selectable scales?  Custom scale editor.)
  (- convert text to screen codes in a better way.)
  (- make a more efficient diskformat. RLE)
  (- more compact memory layout for the song data to be able to use more
    code in the editor.  (maybe dynamic with garbage collect))
  (- names for patterns?)

Intro:
  - Change the logo?
  (- Make it work for both NTSC and PAL.)

Utils:
  - makedisk.pl: should really have more error check.
  - makedisk.pl: refactor!!!
